# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Python and Tableau

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques in Python, and visualizing business insights through interactive Tableau dashboards. The goal is to help stakeholders understand churn behavior and identify retention opportunities.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses. Reducing churn is often more cost-effective than acquiring new customers. The objective of this project is to:
- Predict which customers are likely to churn.
- Understand key drivers behind customer churn using visual analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Building
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data manipulation and visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Tableau**: Interactive Dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code development
- **CSV Dataset**: Provided by the telecom company
